# 3D_LIB_ECM-ReversiblePlating-Aging-Abaqus
## Overview
This repository contains Abaqus input files and user subroutines developed to simulate electro-chemo-mechanical (ECM) coupling in lithium-ion batteries. The models focus on analyzing lithium plating, swelling force evolution, and aging behavior under mechanical constraint, as presented in the related publication.

## Contents
- `input_files/` – Abaqus input files for constrained pouch cell simulations.
- `subroutines/` – User-defined subroutines (UMAT/UEL) for ECM coupling.
- `data/` – Experimental and simulation data.
- `figures/` – Visualizations related to the simulation results.
- `docs/` – Additional documentation and paper references.

## Features
- Coupled electrochemical and mechanical modeling.
- Simulation of lithium plating and stripping dynamics.
- Swelling force prediction during battery cycling.
- Aging characterization under mechanical constraints.
